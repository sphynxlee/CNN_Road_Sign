# CNN_Road_Sign
A project of using CNN to recognize Canada road signs, and using a simulation platform to show how this CNN works.

## How to generate dataset and train CNN model, here is the instruction:
    1. open load_and_normalize_images.py and run it,
    in this step, you will have the dataset file: road_signs_dataset.pkl
    
    2. When step 1 is finished, open random_image.py and run it,
    in this step, the model was trained in your local environment, and you will have the trained result: road_sign_model.pth
